# Sahte Site

Sahte Site - or in English, Fake Site - is a informational project trying to bring attention to the badly configured redirects.

For now, this site will only have a landing page but I plan to add some blog posts talking about where, when and what went wrong; how to fix it and maybe open your mind to prevent the flaw to appear again a second time.
